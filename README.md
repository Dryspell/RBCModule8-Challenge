# RBCModule8-Challenge
This challenge exemplifies standard ETL practices, in this case, extracting data from Kaggle and MovieLens CSVs as well as Wikipedia JSON data, cleanup and loading into a PostgreSQL database via pgAdmin4. 

These steps were separated into four deliverables:

1. [Write an ETL function to read the data files](./ETL_function_test.ipynb)
2. [Extract and Transform Wikipedia data](./ETL_clean_wiki_movies.ipynb)
3. [Extract and Transform the Kaggle data](./ETL_clean_kaggle_data.ipynb)
4. [Create and load the database](./ETL_create_database.ipynb). 

The images, [movies_query](./movies_query.PNG) and [ratings_query](./ratings_query.PNG) confirm that our numbers match the desired results of the challenge.
